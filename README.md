# Image Converter

This is a simple Java program that converts images to black and white. The program can convert a single image or a folder of images to black and white.

To use this program, you will need to have Java installed on your system. To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `Main.java` file is located.
2. Compile the program by running the command `javac Main.java`.
3. Run the program by running the command `java Main`.

This will convert all the images in the `Convert-Images` folder to black and white and save them in the `Convert-Images-BW` folder. The program will also convert the file `Convert-Image/input.jpg` to black and white and save it as `Convert-Image/output.jpg`.

If you encounter any errors or issues with the program, please check your Java installation and make sure that you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed.
